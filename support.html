        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Which trainers are compatible with TrainerKit?</h3>
          <p>
            TrainerKit works with any smart trainer that supports the Bluetooth
            FTMS (Fitness Machine Service) protocol. This includes most trainers
            from Wahoo, Tacx, Elite, Saris, and other major brands manufactured
            in recent years.
          </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I connect my trainer?</h3>
          <p>
            Make sure your trainer is powered on and not connected to another
            app. In TrainerKit, go to the Trainer section and tap "Scan for
            Trainer". Your trainer should appear in the list within a few
            seconds. Tap to connect.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can multiple people use TrainerKit?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes! TrainerKit supports multiple athlete profiles. Each athlete has
            their own FTP, weight, workout history, and platform connections
            (Strava, Intervals.icu). Switch between athletes from the profile
            selector.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How does FTP-based training work?</h3>
          <p>
            All workout targets are expressed as percentages of your Functional
            Threshold Power (FTP). When you update your FTP or switch athletes,
            power targets adjust automatically. This means the same workout
            works for any fitness level.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How do I upload workouts to Strava?</h3>
          <p>
            Connect your Strava account from the athlete profile settings. After
            completing a workout, you can upload it directly to Strava. You can
            also enable automatic uploads so every completed workout syncs
            immediately.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What data is exported in FIT files?</h3>
          <p>
            FIT files include timestamps, power, cadence, heart rate, speed,
            distance, lap markers, and calculated metrics like TSS and
            normalized power. These files are compatible with Strava,
            Intervals.icu, TrainingPeaks, and other platforms.
          </p>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>My trainer isn't showing up. What should I check?</h3>
          <p>
            First, ensure the trainer is powered on and the LED is active. Close
            any other apps that might be connected to the trainer (Zwift, Wahoo
            app, etc.). Check that Bluetooth is enabled on your Mac. Try
            restarting both the trainer and your Mac.
