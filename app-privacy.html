        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</p>

        <p>
          This privacy policy applies to apps developed by Mike Whaley,
          including TrainerKit, UseDryTrails, CoffeeDTRTimer, and any other apps
          that link to this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <p>
          My apps are designed with your privacy in mind. I do not collect,
          store, or transmit your personal data to any servers. All app data is
          stored locally on your device.
        </p>

        <h2>Local Storage</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on the app, data stored locally on your device may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>User preferences and settings</li>
          <li>Workout history and performance data</li>
          <li>Custom content you create within the app</li>
          <li>Connection tokens for third-party services you choose to link</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to
          share it.
        </p>

        <h2>Location Data</h2>
        <p>
          Some apps may request access to your device's location. This data is
          used only for the app's core functionality (such as displaying local
          conditions) and is not stored or transmitted to any external servers.
          You can revoke location access at any time in your device's Settings.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
          Some apps allow you to connect to third-party services (such as Strava
          or Intervals.icu). When you choose to connect these services, data is
          shared according to those services' own privacy policies. I do not
          control how third parties handle your data.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics &amp; Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          My apps do not include any third-party analytics, advertising, or
          tracking SDKs. I do not collect usage data or telemetry.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          Since all data is stored locally on your device, you can delete it at
          any time by clearing the app's data in Settings or by uninstalling the
          app.
        </p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          My apps do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you
          believe a child has provided personal information through one of my
          apps, please contact me so I can address it.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          I may update this privacy policy as my apps evolve. Significant
          changes will be noted in app release notes.
        </p>
